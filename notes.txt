9. Provide Accurate API Documentation
When you make a REST API, you need to help clients (consumers) learn and figure out how to use it correctly. The best way to do this is by providing good documentation for the API.

The documentation should contain:

relevant endpoints of the API
example requests of the endpoints
messages listed for different errors with their status codes
One of the most common tools you can use for API documentation is Swagger. And you can also use Postman, one of the most common API testing tools in software development, to document your APIs.
